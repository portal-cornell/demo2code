==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot (is_in_hand(`jug_1`)) and the objects (is_dirty(`jug_1`)). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
no
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 1-2, the robot picked up jug_1 from counter_1.
* At state 2-3, the robot moved from counter_1 to sink_1.
* At state 3-4, the robot turned on tap_1.
* At state 4-5, the robot picked up sponge_1 from near-sink_1.
* At state 5-6, the robot soaped washing_bowl_1 until it became foamy.
* At state 6-7, the robot turned off tap_1.
* At state 7-8, the robot soaped jug_1 until it became soapy because jug_1 was dirty.
* At state 8-9, the robot turned on tap_1.
* At state 9-10, the robot rinsed jug_1 until it became clean.
* At state 10-11, the robot placed jug_1 in drying_rack_1.
* At state 11-12, the robot moved from sink_1 to drying_rack_1.
* At state 12-13, the robot moved from drying_rack_1 to sink_1.
* At state 13-14, the robot picked up jug_2 from near-sink_1.
* At state 14-15, the robot turned on tap_1.
* At state 15-16, the robot rinsed jug_2 until it became clean.
* At state 16-17, the robot turned off tap_1.
* At state 17-18, the robot moved from sink_1 to drying_rack_1.
* At state 18-19, the robot placed jug_2 in drying_rack_1.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "picked up", "moved", etc.
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks.
High-level subtasks are compacted enough because they cannot be combined together without losing important information.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* There are 2 jugs that got washed: [jug_1, jug_2]
* The list of high-level actions that happened in order is: [pick up jug_1, move from counter_1 to sink_1, turn on tap_1, pick up sponge_1, soap washing_bowl_1, turn off tap_1, soap jug_1, rinse jug_1, place jug_1 in drying_rack_1, move from sink_1 to drying_rack_1, pick up jug_2, turn on tap_1, rinse jug_2, turn off tap_1, move from sink_1 to drying_rack_1, place jug_2 in drying_rack_1]
* The actions [pick up, move, turn on tap, pick up sponge, soap, turn off tap, soap, rinse, place] are repeated for each jug, so we can use a loop.
* Rinsing involves the use of tap water, which is why it is turned on at some point before the rinse cycle, and turned off after.
[[Task Specification:]]
Wash objects at the sink. All cleaned objects should be placed in the drying rack.
Specifically -

Get a list of all objects to wash
For each object in all objects:
  Pick up object
  Move from current location to sink_1
  Turn on tap_1
  Pick up sponge_1
  Soap washing_bowl_1
  Turn off tap_1
  Soap object
  Rinse object
  Place object in drying_rack_1
  Move from sink_1 to drying_rack_1
