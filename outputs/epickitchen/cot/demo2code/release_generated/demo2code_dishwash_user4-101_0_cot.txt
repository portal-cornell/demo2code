==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot (at(`desk_1`)) and the object (is_dirty(`mug_1`)). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
no
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 1-2, the robot picked up mug_1 from desk_1.
* At state 2-3, the robot moved from desk_1 to sink_1. The robot picked up sponge_1.
* At state 3-4, the robot turned on tap_1.
* At state 4-5, the robot soaped mug_1 until it became soapy because mug_1 was dirty.
* At state 5-6, the robot rinsed mug_1 until it became clean.
* At state 6-7, the robot turned off tap_1.
* At state 7-8, the robot moved from sink_1 to kitchentop_1. The robot placed mug_1 on kitchentop_1.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "picked up", "moved", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtasks are compacted enough because they cannot be combined together without losing important information.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]

* At state 2-3, the robot moved from desk_1 to sink_1 and picked up sponge_1.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* There is 1 dish that got washed: [mug_1]
* The list of high level actions that happened in order is: [pick up mug_1, move from desk_1 to sink_1, pick up sponge_1, turn on tap_1, soap mug_1, rinse mug_1, turn off tap_1, move from sink_1 to kitchentop_1, place mug_1 on kitchentop_1]
* The actions [pick up, move, pick up, turn on tap, soap, rinse, turn off tap, move, place] are repeated for each dish, so we can use a loop.
* Rinsing involves the use of tap water, which is why it is turned on at some point before the rinse cycle, and turned off after.
[[Task Specification:]]
Wash dishes at the sink. All cleaned objects should be placed at the kitchentop.
Specifically -

Get a list of all objects to wash
For each object in all objects:
  Pick up object
  Move from current location to sink_1
  Pick up sponge_1
  Turn on tap_1
  Soap object
  Rinse object
  Turn off tap_1
  Move from sink_1 to kitchentop_1
  Place object on kitchentop_1
