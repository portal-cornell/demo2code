==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot (is_in_hand(`fork_1`)) and the objects (is_dirty(`plate_1`)). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
no
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 1-2, the robot picked up fork_1, fork_2, and fork_3.
* At state 2-3, the robot moved from near-sink_1 to sink_1. The robot picked up sponge_1, which was foamy.
* At state 3-4, the robot soaped fork_1 until it became soapy.
* At state 4-5, the robot soaped fork_2 until it became soapy.
* At state 5-6, the robot soaped fork_3 until it became soapy.
* At state 6-7, the robot turned on tap_1.
* At state 7-8, the robot rinsed fork_1 until it became clean.
* At state 8-9, the robot rinsed fork_2 until it became clean.
* At state 9-10, the robot turned off tap_1. The robot cleaned fork_3.
* At state 10-11, the robot placed fork_1, fork_2, and fork_3 on dishrack_1.
* At state 11-12, the robot moved from near-sink_1 to sink_1. The robot picked up plate_1.
* At state 12-13, the robot turned on tap_1. The robot picked up sponge_1, which was foamy.
* At state 13-14, the robot soaped plate_1 until it became soapy.
* At state 14-15, the robot turned on tap_1.
* At state 15-16, the robot rinsed plate_1 until it became clean. The robot turned off tap_1.
* At state 16-17, the robot placed plate_1 on dishrack_1.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "picked up", "moved", etc.
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks.
High-level subtasks are compacted enough because they cannot be combined together without losing important information.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* There are 4 dishes that got washed: [fork_1, fork_2, fork_3, plate_1]
* The list of high-level actions that happened in order is: [pick up forks, move to sink, pick up sponge, soap forks, turn on tap, rinse forks, turn off tap, clean fork_3, place forks on dishrack, move to sink, pick up plate, turn on tap, pick up sponge, soap plate, turn on tap, rinse plate, turn off tap, place plate on dishrack]
* The actions [pick up forks, move to sink, pick up sponge, soap forks, turn on tap, rinse forks, turn off tap, place forks on dishrack] are repeated for each fork, so we can use a loop.
* The actions [move to sink, pick up plate, turn on tap, pick up sponge, soap plate, turn on tap, rinse plate, turn off tap, place plate on dishrack] are specific to the plate, so we can handle it separately.
* Rinsing involves the use of tap water, which is why it is turned on at some point before the rinse cycle, and turned off after.
[[Task Specification:]]
Wash dishes at the sink. All cleaned objects should be placed at the dishrack.
