==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot (at(`stove_1`)) and the object (is_dirty(`pan_1`)). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
no
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 1-2, the robot picked up pan_1 from stove_1.
* At state 2-3, the robot moved from stove_1 to sink_1. The robot picked up sponge_1.
* At state 3-4, the robot turned on tap_1. The robot soaped pan_1 until it became soapy because pan_1 was dirty.
* At state 4-5, the robot rinsed pan_1 until it became clean.
* At state 5-6, the robot turned off tap_1. The robot placed pan_1 on dishrack_1.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "picked up", "moved", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtasks are compacted enough because they cannot be combined together without losing important information.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 1-3, the robot brought pan_1 from stove_1 to sink_1. The robot also picked up sponge_1.
* At state 3-4, the robot turned on tap_1 and soaped pan_1 until it became soapy because pan_1 was dirty.
* At state 4-5, the robot rinsed pan_1 until it became clean.
* At state 5-6, the robot turned off tap_1 and placed pan_1 on dishrack_1.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* There is 1 dish that got washed: [pan_1]
* The list of high-level actions that happened in order is: [move dish from A to B, pick up sponge, turn on tap, soap, rinse, turn off tap, place dish on dishrack]
* The actions [pick up sponge, turn on tap, soap, rinse, turn off tap] are repeated for each dish, so we can use a loop.
* Rinsing involves the use of tap water, which is why it is turned on at some point before the rinse cycle, and turned off after.
[[Task Specification:]]
Wash dishes at the sink. All cleaned objects should be placed at the dishrack.
Specifically -

Get a list of all objects to wash
For each object in all objects:
  Bring object from stove_1 to sink_1
  Pick up sponge_1
  Turn on tap_1
  Soap object
  Rinse object
  Turn off tap_1
  Place object on dishrack_1
