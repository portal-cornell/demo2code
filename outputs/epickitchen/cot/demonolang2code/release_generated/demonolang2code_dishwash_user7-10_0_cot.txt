==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot (is_in_hand(`pan_1`)) and the objects (is_dirty(`pan_1`)). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
no
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2-3, the robot picked up pan_1. The robot picked up sponge_1.
* At state 3-4, the robot moved from countertop_1 to sink_1.
* At state 4-5, the robot turned on tap_1. The robot soaped pan_1 until it became soapy because pan_1 was dirty.
* At state 5-6, the robot rinsed pan_1 until it became clean.
* At state 6-7, the robot turned off tap_1. The robot placed pan_1 in dishrack_1.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "picked up", "moved", etc.
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks.
High-level subtasks are compacted enough because they cannot be combined together without losing important information.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* There is 1 dish that got washed: [pan_1]
* The list of high level actions that happened in order is: [pick up, move from A to B, turn on tap, soap, rinse, turn off tap, place]
* The actions are straightforward and do not require any loops.
* Rinsing involves the use of tap water, which is why it was turned on at some point before the rinse cycle, and turned off after.
[[Task Specification:]]
Wash a dish at a sink and place it in a dishrack.
Specifically -

Pick up pan_1 and sponge_1
Move from countertop_1 to sink_1
Turn on tap_1
Soap pan_1 until it becomes soapy
Rinse pan_1 until it becomes clean
Turn off tap_1
Place pan_1 in dishrack_1
