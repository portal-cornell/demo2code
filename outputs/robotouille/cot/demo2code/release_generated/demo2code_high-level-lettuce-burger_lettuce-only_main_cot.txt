==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is holding 'lettuce1') and the status of the objects ('lettuce1' is not at 'table2'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.

no
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved from 'table1' to 'table2'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up 'lettuce1'.
* At state 4, the robot moved from 'table2' to 'cutting_board1'.
* At state 5, the robot placed 'lettuce1' at location 'cutting_board1'.
* At state 6-8, the robot had cut 'lettuce1'.
* At state 9, the robot picked up 'lettuce1'.
* At state 10, the robot moved from 'cutting_board1' to 'table3'.
* At state 11, the robot placed 'lettuce1' on top of 'bottom_bun1' at location 'table3'.

[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "moved", "picked up", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtask trajectory is the most compacted form that cannot be summarized anymore.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.

yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved from 'table1' to 'table2'.
* At state 3-8, the subtask is "cut lettuce". This subtask contains: 1. picking up 'lettuce1' (state 3) 2. moving to place 'lettuce1' on 'cutting_board1' (state 4-5) 3. cutting 'lettuce1' until it is cut (state 6-8)
* At state 9-11, the subtask is "stack lettuce on top of bottom bun". This subtask contains: 1. picking up 'lettuce1' (state 9) 2. moving to stack 'lettuce1' on 'bottom_bun1' (state 10-11)
* At state 12-15, the subtask is "stack top bun on top of lettuce". This subtask contains: 1. moving to pick up 'top_bun1' (state 13-14) 2. moving to stack 'top_bun1' on 'lettuce1' (state 14-15)

[[Reasoning:]]
* In [Scenario 1]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cut lettuce', 'stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* In [Scenario 2]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cut lettuce', 'stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* Both scenarios are executing the subtasks in the same order.
* There is no repetition or loop in the subtask ordering for any individual scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Cut a lettuce before stacking it on top of a bottom bun. Then stack a top bun on top of the lettuce.

Specifically:
Get a list of all the lettuces in the kitchen.
Get a list of all the bottom buns in the kitchen.
Get a list of all the top buns in the kitchen.

Decide a lettuce to use.
Get a list of all the available cutting boards in the kitchen. 
Decide a cutting board to go to.
Cut that lettuce at that cutting board.

Decide a bottom bun to use. 
Stack the lettuce on top of the bottom bun.

Decide a top bun to use. 
Stack the top bun on top of the lettuce.
