==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is at 'stove1') and the status of the objects ('patty1' is not at 'stove1'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.

The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is holding 'patty3') and the status of the objects ('patty3' is not at 'table7'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks.

[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "moved", "picked up", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtask trajectory is the most compacted form that cannot be summarized anymore.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2-9, the subtask is "cook patty". This subtask contains: 1. moving to pick up 'patty1' (state 2-3) 2. moving to place 'patty1' on 'stove4' (state 4-5) 3. cooking 'patty1' until it is cooked (state 6-9)
* At state 10-16, the subtask is "cut lettuce". This subtask contains: 1. moving to pick up 'lettuce1' (state 11-12) 2. moving to place 'lettuce1' on 'cutting_board1' (state 13) 3. cutting 'lettuce1' until it is cut (state 14-16)
* At state 17-24, the subtask is "stack lettuce on top of patty". This subtask contains: 1. moving to pick up 'lettuce1' (state 22-23) 2. moving to stack 'lettuce1' on top of 'patty1' (state 24)
* At state 25-28, the subtask is "stack top bun on top of lettuce". This subtask contains: 1. moving to pick up 'top_bun1' (state 26-27) 2. moving to stack 'top_bun1' on top of 'lettuce1' (state 28)

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* In [Scenario 1]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook patty', 'cut lettuce', 'stack lettuce on top of patty', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* In [Scenario 2]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook patty', 'cut lettuce', 'stack lettuce on top of patty', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* Both scenarios are executing the subtasks in the same order.
* There is no repetition or loop in the subtask ordering for any individual scenario.
