==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is holding 'chicken1') and the status of the objects ('chicken1' is not at 'table8'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
no

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "moved", "picked up", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtask trajectory is the most compacted form that cannot be summarized anymore.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2-9, the subtask is "cook chicken". This subtask contains: 1. moving to pick up 'chicken1' (state 2-3) 2. moving to place 'chicken1' on 'stove2' (state 4-5) 3. cooking 'chicken1' until it is cooked (state 6-9)
* At state 10-13, the subtask is "stack chicken on top of bottom bun". This subtask contains: 1. picking up 'chicken1' (state 10) 2. moving to stack 'chicken1' on 'bottom_bun1' (state 11-12) 3. moving to 'table3' (state 13)
* At state 14-19, the subtask is "cut lettuce". This subtask contains: 1. picking up 'lettuce1' (state 14) 2. moving to place 'lettuce1' on 'cutting_board1' (state 15-16) 3. cutting 'lettuce1' until it is cut (state 17-19)
* At state 20-23, the subtask is "stack lettuce on top of chicken". This subtask contains: 1. picking up 'lettuce1' (state 20) 2. moving to stack 'lettuce1' on 'chicken1' (state 21-22) 3. moving to 'table4' (state 23)
* At state 24-26, the subtask is "stack top bun on top of lettuce". This subtask contains: 1. moving to pick up 'top_bun1' (state 24) 2. moving to stack 'top_bun1' on 'lettuce1' (state 25-26)

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* In [Scenario 1]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook chicken', 'stack chicken on top of bottom bun', 'cut lettuce', 'stack lettuce on top of chicken', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* In [Scenario 2]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook chicken', 'stack lettuce on top of chicken', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* 'stack lettuce on top of chicken' and 'stack top bun on top of lettuce' are common subtasks in both scenarios.
* Both scenarios are executing the subtasks in the same order.
* There is repetition in the subtask ordering for [Scenario 2], so we can use a for-loop in our specification for that part.
