[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is at 'table13') and the status of the objects ('patty1' is not at 'table13'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.

The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "picked up", "moved", etc.
