==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is at 'stove1') and the status of the objects ('patty1' is not at 'stove1'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.

[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "moved", "picked up", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtask trajectory is the most compacted form that cannot be summarized anymore.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.

[[Reasoning:]]
* In [Scenario 1]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook patty', 'stack patty on top of bottom bun', 'move from table2 to table1', 'cook patty', 'stack patty on top of bottom bun'].
* In [Scenario 2]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook patty', 'prepare lettuce', 'prepare top bun', 'cook patty', 'prepare lettuce', 'prepare top bun'].
* Both scenarios are executing the subtasks in the same order.
* There is no repetition or loop in the subtask ordering for any individual scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Make two burgers.

Specifically:
Get a list of all the patties in the kitchen.
Get a list of all the bottom buns in the kitchen.

For two burgers, do:
  Decide a patty to use.
  Get a list of all the available stoves in the kitchen.
  Decide a stove to go to.
  Cook that patty at that stove.

  Decide a bottom bun to use.
  Stack the patty on top of the bottom bun.

  Decide a lettuce to use.
  Get a list of all the available cutting boards in the kitchen.
  Decide a cutting board to go to.
  Cut that lettuce at that cutting board.
  Pick up that lettuce.
  Move to place that lettuce on top of the patty.

  Decide a top bun to use.
  Move to pick up that top bun.
  Move to place that top bun on top of the lettuce.
