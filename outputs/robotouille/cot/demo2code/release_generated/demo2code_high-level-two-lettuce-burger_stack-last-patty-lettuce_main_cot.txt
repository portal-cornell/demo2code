==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is at 'table5') and the status of the objects ('lettuce1' is not at 'table5'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "moved", "picked up", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtask trajectory is the most compacted form that cannot be summarized anymore.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* In [Scenario 1]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cut lettuce', 'cook patty', 'stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack top bun on top of patty'].
* In [Scenario 2]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cut lettuce', 'cook patty', 'stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack patty on top of lettuce', 'stack top bun on top of patty'].
* 'stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack patty on top of lettuce', and 'stack top bun on top of patty' are essentially the same subtask. 
* Both scenarios are executing the subtasks in the same order.
* In both scenarios, we see that the subset ['cut lettuce', 'cook patty'] got repeated 2 times consecutively, so we can use a for-loop in our specification. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Make two burgers.

Specifically:
Get a list of all the lettuces in the kitchen.
Get a list of all the patties in the kitchen.
Get a list of all the bottom buns in the kitchen.

For two burgers, do:
  Decide a lettuce to use.
  Get a list of all the available cutting boards in the kitchen. 
  Decide a cutting board to go to.
  Cut that lettuce at that cutting board.

  Decide a patty to use.
  Get a list of all the available stoves in the kitchen.
  Decide a stove to go to.
  Cook that patty at that stove.

  Decide a bottom bun to use.
  Stack the lettuce on top of the bottom bun.

  Decide a top bun to use.
  Stack the top bun on top of the patty.
