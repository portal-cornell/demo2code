==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is holding 'chicken1') and the status of the objects ('chicken1' is not at 'table15'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "moved", "picked up", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtask trajectory is the most compacted form that cannot be summarized anymore.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.

yes

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* In [Scenario 1]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook chicken', 'stack chicken on top of bottom bun', 'cut lettuce', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce', 'cook chicken', 'stack chicken on top of bottom bun', 'cut lettuce', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* In [Scenario 2]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook chicken', 'stack lettuce on top of chicken', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce', 'cook chicken', 'stack lettuce on top of chicken', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* 'stack chicken on top of bottom bun' and 'stack lettuce on top of chicken' are essentially the same subtask. 
* Both scenarios are executing the subtasks in the same order.
* There is no repetition or loop in the subtask ordering for any individual scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]

Specifically:
Get a list of all the chickens in the kitchen.
