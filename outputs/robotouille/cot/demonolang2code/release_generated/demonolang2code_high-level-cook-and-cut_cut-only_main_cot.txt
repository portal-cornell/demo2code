==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is at 'table2') and the status of the objects ('lettuce1' is not at 'table2'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
no
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved from 'table1' to 'table2'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up 'lettuce1'.
* At state 4, the robot moved from 'table2' to 'cutting_board1'.
* At state 5, the robot placed 'lettuce1' at location 'cutting_board1'.
* At state 6-8, the robot had cut 'lettuce1'.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "moved", "picked up", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtask trajectory is the most compacted form that cannot be summarized anymore.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved from 'table1' to 'table2'.
* At state 3-8, the subtask is "cut lettuce". This subtask contains: 1. picking up 'lettuce1' (state 3) 2. moving to place 'lettuce1' on 'cutting_board1' (state 4) 3. cutting 'lettuce1' until it is cut (state 6-8)

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* In [Scenario 1]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cut lettuce'].
* In [Scenario 2]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cut lettuce'].
* Both scenarios are executing the subtasks in the same order.
* There is no repetition or loop in the subtask ordering for any individual scenario.
* In [Scenario 1], there is an additional step where the robot moves from 'table1' to 'table2'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
Move from 'table1' to 'table2'.

Get a list of all the lettuces in the kitchen.

Decide a lettuce to use.
Get a list of all the available cutting boards in the kitchen. 
Decide a cutting board to go to.
Cut that lettuce at that cutting board.
