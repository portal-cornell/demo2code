==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the robot ('robot1' is at 'stove1') and the status of the objects ('patty1' is not at 'stove1'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions. 
Low-level actions are not compacted enough yet because low-level actions can still be combined into high-level subtasks. 
The new trajectory will NOT be sufficiently summarized.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains low-level actions because the trajectory mentions "moved", "picked up", etc. 
I will summarize the low-level action trajectory into high-level subtasks. 
High-level subtask trajectory is the most compacted form that cannot be summarized anymore.
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
* In [Scenario 1]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook patty', 'cut lettuce', 'stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce', 'cook patty', 'cut lettuce', 'stack lettuce on top of patty', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* In [Scenario 2]'s unique kitchen environment, the subtasks were executed in this order: ['cook patty', 'stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack patty on top of bottom bun', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce', 'cook patty', 'stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack patty on top of bottom bun', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'].
* There is repetition in the subtask ordering for both scenarios.
* We can see that the subset ['cook patty', 'cut lettuce', 'stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'] got repeated 2 times consecutively in [Scenario 1], and the subset ['stack lettuce on top of bottom bun', 'stack patty on top of bottom bun', 'stack top bun on top of lettuce'] got repeated 2 times consecutively in [Scenario 2].
* We can use a for-loop for the repeated subsets in our specification.
