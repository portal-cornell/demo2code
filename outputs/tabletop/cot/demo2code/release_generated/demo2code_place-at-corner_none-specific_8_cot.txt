==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the object ('cyan cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan cylinder' to the 'top right corner'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because two scenarios have two different corners ('top right corner', 'top left corner'), we assume that the 'cyan cylinder' can be at any random corner. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the cyan cylinder at any random corner.
