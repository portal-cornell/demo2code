==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the object ('orange cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' at 'top left corner'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the goal is to place the "orange cylinder" at the corner, and the trajectories show that it can be placed at different corners ('top left corner', 'top right corner'), we assume that the "orange cylinder" can be placed at any random corner.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the orange cylinder at any random corner.
