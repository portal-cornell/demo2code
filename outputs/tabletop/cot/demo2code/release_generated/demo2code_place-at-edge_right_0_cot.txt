==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the object ('red block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'red block' to the 'right edge'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because there is only one scenario, we assume that the 'red block' must always be placed at the 'right edge'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the red block at the right edge.
