==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' is behind 'green cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed the 'green cylinder' in front of the 'orange block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
With only 1 scenario, we assume that the 'green cylinder' must always be placed in front of the 'orange block'. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the green cylinder in front of the orange block.
