==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' is to the left of 'purple block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block' to the left of 'purple block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
With only 1 scenario, we assume that the 'cyan block' must always be to the left of 'purple block'. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the cyan block to the left of the purple block.
