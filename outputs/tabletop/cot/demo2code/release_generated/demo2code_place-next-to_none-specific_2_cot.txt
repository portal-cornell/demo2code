==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' is in front of 'orange cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed the 'orange cylinder' behind the 'green block' and in front of the 'yellow cylinder'.

yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 2], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange cylinder' to the right of 'yellow cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because two scenarios have two different relative positions between 'orange cylinder' and 'yellow cylinder', we assume that the 'orange cylinder' can be anywhere next to 'yellow cylinder'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the orange cylinder at anywhere next to the yellow cylinder.
