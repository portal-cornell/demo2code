==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('yellow cylinder' is to the right of 'pink cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' to the left of 'yellow cylinder'.

The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('yellow cylinder' is in front of 'pink cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.

The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 2], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' behind 'yellow cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because two scenarios have two different relative positions between 'pink cylinder' and 'yellow cylinder', we assume that the 'pink cylinder' can be anywhere next to 'yellow cylinder'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the pink cylinder at anywhere next to the yellow cylinder.
