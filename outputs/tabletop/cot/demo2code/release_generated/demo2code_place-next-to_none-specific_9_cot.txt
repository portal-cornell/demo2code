==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' is to the right of 'pink block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' to the right of 'brown cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the goal is to place the "pink block" next to the "brown cylinder", we need to consider the relative position between them.

In [Scenario 1], the "pink block" is placed to the right of the "brown cylinder".
In [Scenario 2], the "pink block" is placed to the left of the "brown cylinder".

Based on these two scenarios, we can conclude that the "pink block" can be placed on either side of the "brown cylinder".
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the pink block on either side of the brown cylinder.
