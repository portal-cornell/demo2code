==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' is to the right of 'pink cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' to the left of 'orange block' and to the right of 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the given trajectory, the 'pink cylinder' needs to be placed both to the left of 'orange block' and to the right of 'cyan block'. This means that the 'pink cylinder' needs to be placed between the 'orange block' and the 'cyan block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the pink cylinder between the orange block and the cyan block.
