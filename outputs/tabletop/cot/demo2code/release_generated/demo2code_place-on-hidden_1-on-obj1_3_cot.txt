==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory in Scenario 1, the robot first places the 'purple block' on the table and then places the 'orange block' on top of the 'red block'. 

[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Place the purple block on the table.
2. Place the orange block on top of the red block.
