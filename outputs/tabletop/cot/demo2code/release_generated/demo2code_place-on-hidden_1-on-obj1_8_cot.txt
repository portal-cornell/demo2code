==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'brown block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory in Scenario 1, the robot first places the 'pink cylinder' on top of the 'table', and then places the 'cyan block' on top of the 'brown block'. There is no repetition or loop in this trajectory.

[[Task Specification:]]
Place the cyan block on top of the brown block.
