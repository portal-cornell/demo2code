==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('yellow cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'green block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 4, the goal is to place the 'cyan block' on top of the 'green block'. There are no other subtasks or trajectories mentioned in the scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the cyan block on top of the green block.
