==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 4, the goal is to place the 'green block' on top of the 'red block'. The trajectories show that the 'purple block' and 'green cylinder' are placed on the table before placing the 'green block' on top of the 'red block'. 

[[Task Specification:]]
1. Place the purple block on the table.
2. Place the green cylinder on the table.
3. Place the green block on top of the red block.
