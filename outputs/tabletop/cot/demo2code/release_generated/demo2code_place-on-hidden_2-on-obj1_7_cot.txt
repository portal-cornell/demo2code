==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 4, the goal is to place the 'brown cylinder' on top of the 'red block'. The trajectories show that the robot needs to move other objects ('red cylinder', 'purple block') before finally placing the 'brown cylinder' on top of the 'red block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Place the red cylinder on the table.
2. Place the purple block on the table.
3. Place the brown cylinder on top of the red block.
