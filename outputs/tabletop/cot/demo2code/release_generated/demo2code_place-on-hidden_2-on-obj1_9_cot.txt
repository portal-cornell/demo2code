==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'blue cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 4, the goal is to place the 'yellow block' on top of the 'blue cylinder'. The trajectories leading up to this state are not relevant to the goal.

[[Task Specification:]]
Place the yellow block on top of the blue cylinder.
