==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot moved 'brown cylinder' and placed it in front of 'orange block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'gray cylinder' and placed it on top of 'table'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'red cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 5, the goal is to place the 'orange block' on top of the 'red cylinder'. The other actions in the trajectories are not relevant to the goal.

[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
Place the orange block on top of the red cylinder.
