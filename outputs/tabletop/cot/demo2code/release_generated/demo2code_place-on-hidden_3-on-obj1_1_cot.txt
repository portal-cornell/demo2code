==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'table'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'purple cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 5, the goal is to place the 'brown block' on top of the 'purple cylinder'. The trajectories leading up to this state are not relevant to the goal.

[[Task Specification:]]
Place the brown block on top of the purple cylinder.
