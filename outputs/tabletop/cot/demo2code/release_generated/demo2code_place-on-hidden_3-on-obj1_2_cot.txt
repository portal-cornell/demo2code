==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'purple cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'table'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 5, the goal is to place the 'orange cylinder' on top of the 'cyan block'. The trajectories leading up to this state involve moving other objects ('purple cylinder', 'green block', 'blue block') before finally placing the 'orange cylinder' on top of the 'cyan block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Place the purple cylinder on the table.
2. Place the green block on the table.
3. Place the blue block on the table.
4. Place the orange cylinder on top of the cyan block.
