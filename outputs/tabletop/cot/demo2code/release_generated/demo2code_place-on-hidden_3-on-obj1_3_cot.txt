==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' to the right of 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'table'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 5, the goal is to place the 'purple block' on top of the 'pink cylinder'. The other blocks ('orange block', 'brown block', 'green block') are not relevant to the goal.

[[Task Specification:]]
Place the purple block on top of the pink cylinder.
