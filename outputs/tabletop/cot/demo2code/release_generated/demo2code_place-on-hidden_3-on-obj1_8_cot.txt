==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink block'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'cyan cylinder'.
* At state 4, the robot moved 'purple block'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'blue block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, there are no repeated subtasks or loops. The goal is to place the 'gray cylinder' on the 'blue block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the gray cylinder on the blue block.
