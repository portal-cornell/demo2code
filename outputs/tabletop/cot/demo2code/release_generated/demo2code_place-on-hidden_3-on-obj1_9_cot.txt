==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink block'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'yellow block' and placed it in front of 'brown cylinder'.
* At state 4, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'green block' and placed it on top of 'purple cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory in [Scenario 1], the robot needs to move 'pink block', 'yellow block', 'gray cylinder', and finally place 'green block' on top of 'purple cylinder'.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the pink block.
2. Move the yellow block and place it in front of the brown cylinder.
3. Move the gray cylinder.
4. Move the green block and place it on top of the purple cylinder.
