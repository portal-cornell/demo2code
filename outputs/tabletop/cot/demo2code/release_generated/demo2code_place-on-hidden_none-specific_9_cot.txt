==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' is on top of 'red block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
With only 1 scenario, we assume that the 'purple block' must always be placed on top of the 'red block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the purple block on top of the red block.
