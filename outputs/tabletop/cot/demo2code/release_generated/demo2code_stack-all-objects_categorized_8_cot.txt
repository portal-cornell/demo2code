==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'gray block'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'gray block'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'cyan cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'. 
* At state 8, the robot picked up and placed 'purple cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all objects into two stacks, and objects may need to be categorized in the stacks", we focus on whether the objects are stacked by type.

Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['gray block', 'red block', 'green block', 'orange block'].
Based on States 6-8, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['cyan cylinder', 'orange cylinder', 'purple cylinder'].

Because the blocks and cylinders are stacked separately, we assume that the objects need to be categorized in the stacks.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into one stack and all cylinders into another stack.
