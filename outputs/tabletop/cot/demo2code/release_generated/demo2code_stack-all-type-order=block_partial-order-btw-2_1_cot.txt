==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'orange block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'brown block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all blocks into one stack, while enforcing the order...", we focus on whether there is any ordering requirement.

In [Scenario 1], based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['orange block', 'yellow block', 'brown block', 'green block'].
In [Scenario 2], based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['orange block', 'yellow block', 'green block', 'brown block'].

Between the order of blocks in these two scenarios, the ordering that stays the same is ['orange block', 'yellow block'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into one stack. Also make sure that the stacking enforces the bottom to top order between these blocks: ['orange block', 'yellow block'].
