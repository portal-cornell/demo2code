==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' is to the left of 'yellow block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'yellow block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'gray block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'purple block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all blocks into one stack, while enforcing the order...", we focus on whether there is any ordering requirement.

In [Scenario 1], based on States 2-5, the blocks from bottom to top in the stack are ['yellow block', 'gray block', 'purple block', 'green block'].
In [Scenario 2], based on States 2-5, the blocks from bottom to top in the stack are ['gray block', 'purple block', 'green block', 'yellow block'].

Between the order of blocks in these two scenarios, the ordering that stays the same is ['gray block', 'purple block', 'green block'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into one stack. Also make sure that the stacking enforces the bottom to top order between these blocks: ['gray block', 'purple block', 'green block'].
