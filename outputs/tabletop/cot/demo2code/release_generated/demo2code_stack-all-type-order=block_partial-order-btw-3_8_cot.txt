==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'brown block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' on top of 'purple block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all blocks into one stack, while enforcing the order...", we focus on whether there is any ordering requirement.

In [Scenario 1], based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['cyan block', 'brown block', 'purple block', 'red block'].
In [Scenario 2], based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['red block', 'cyan block', 'brown block', 'purple block'].

Between the order of blocks in these two scenarios, the ordering that stays the same is ['cyan block', 'brown block', 'purple block'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into one stack. Also make sure that the stacking enforces the bottom to top order between these blocks: ['cyan block', 'brown block', 'purple block'].
