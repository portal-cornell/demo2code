==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' is not on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 3, the robot moved 'brown block'.
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'brown block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'orange block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all blocks into one stack, while enforcing the order...", we focus on whether there is any ordering requirement.

Based on States 3-5 in both scenarios, the order of blocks in the stack is ['brown block', 'orange block', 'purple block'].

In Scenario 2, there are additional movements and placements of blocks before reaching the final stack. However, the order of the blocks in the final stack remains the same.

[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into one stack. Also make sure that the stacking enforces the bottom to top order between these blocks: ['brown block', 'orange block', 'purple block'].
