==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' is to the right of 'brown cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'brown cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all cylinders into one stack, while enforcing the order...", we focus on whether there is any ordering requirement.

Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['brown cylinder', 'pink cylinder', 'cyan cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'].

There is an ordering requirement between the cylinders: ['brown cylinder', 'pink cylinder', 'cyan cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders into one stack. Also make sure that the stacking enforces the bottom to top order between these cylinders: ['brown cylinder', 'pink cylinder', 'cyan cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'].
