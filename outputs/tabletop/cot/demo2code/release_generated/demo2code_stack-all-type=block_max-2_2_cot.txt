==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'purple block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'blue block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because there is only one scenario, we assume that the 'blue block' is not part of the stacking task. Therefore, the task is to stack the 'purple block' and 'pink block' only.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the purple block and pink block. However, the maximum height of the stack is not specified.
