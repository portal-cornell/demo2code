==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because there is only one scenario, we assume that the 'cyan block' is not part of the stacking task. Therefore, we only consider the stacking of 'gray block' and 'yellow block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the gray block and yellow block. However, the maximum height of the stack is not specified.
