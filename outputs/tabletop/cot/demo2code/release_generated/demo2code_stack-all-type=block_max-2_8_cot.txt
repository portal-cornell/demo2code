==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink block' behind 'cyan block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'pink block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because there is only one scenario, we assume that the 'pink block' must always be behind the 'cyan block'. 
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the pink block behind the cyan block.
2. Place the purple block on top of the pink block.
3. Move the cyan block.
