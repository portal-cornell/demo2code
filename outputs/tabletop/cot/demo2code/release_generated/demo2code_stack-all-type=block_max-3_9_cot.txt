==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'gray block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 5, the robot moved 'yellow block'. 
* At state 6, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'yellow block'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'brown block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all blocks, where enfocing the maximum stack height...", we focus on how high the stacks are.

Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['cyan block', 'gray block', 'orange block']. This is 3 blocks high.
Based on States 5-7, in the second stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['yellow block', 'brown block', 'green block']. This is 3 blocks high.

Because there are 2 stacks and both stacks are 3 blocks high, we assume that each stack needs to be at most 3 blocks high.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks. However, the maximum height of each stack is 3.
