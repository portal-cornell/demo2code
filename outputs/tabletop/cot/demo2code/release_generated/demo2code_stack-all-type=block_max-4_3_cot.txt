==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' is behind 'blue block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange block' and placed it behind 'blue block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'orange block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'blue block'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'brown block' and placed it to the right of 'orange block', on top of 'blue block', and on top of 'pink block'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' on top of 'gray block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectories, the blocks are stacked in a specific order. The 'orange block' is at the bottom, followed by 'blue block', 'pink block', 'brown block', and 'gray block' with 'red block' on top. 

[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks in the following order: 'orange block', 'blue block', 'pink block', 'brown block', 'gray block', 'red block'. However, the maximum height of a stack is not specified.
