==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('yellow block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'yellow block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 6, the robot moved 'blue block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all blocks, where enforcing the maximum stack height...", we focus on how high the stacks are.

Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['yellow block', 'pink block', 'orange block', 'purple block']. This is 4 blocks high.

Because there is only one stack and the stack is 4 blocks high, we assume that the maximum height of the stack is 4.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks. However, the maximum height of the stack is 4.
