==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'purple block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'gray block' on top of 'pink block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because there is only one scenario, we assume that the maximum stack height is not enforced. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks without enforcing the maximum stack height.
