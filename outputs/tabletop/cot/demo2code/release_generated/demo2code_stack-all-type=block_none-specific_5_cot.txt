==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block' in front of 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'gray block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because there is only one scenario, we assume that the 'gray block' must be in front of the 'green cylinder' before placing the 'orange block' on top of it. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the gray block in front of the green cylinder. Then, place the orange block on top of the gray block.
