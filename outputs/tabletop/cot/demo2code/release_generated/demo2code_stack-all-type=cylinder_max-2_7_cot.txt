==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red cylinder' is not on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all cylinders, where enforcing the maximum stack height...", we focus on how high the stacks are.

Based on States 2-3, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['blue cylinder', 'red cylinder']. This is 2 cylinders high.

Because there is only one stack and the tallest stack is 2 cylinders high, we assume that the maximum height of the stack is 2.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders. However, the maximum height of the stack is 2.
