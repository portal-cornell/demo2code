==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'red cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all cylinders, where enforcing the maximum stack height...", we focus on how high the stacks are.

Based on States 2-3, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['pink cylinder', 'orange cylinder']. This is 2 cylinders high.

Based on State 4, there is a second stack with only one cylinder, which is 'red cylinder'.

Because there are 2 stacks and the tallest stack is 2 cylinders high, we assume that each stack needs to be at most 2 cylinders high.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders. However, the maximum height of a stack is 2.
