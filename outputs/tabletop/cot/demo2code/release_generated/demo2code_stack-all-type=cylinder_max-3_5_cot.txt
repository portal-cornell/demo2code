==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 6, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'purple cylinder' on top of 'brown cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all cylinders, where enforcing the maximum stack height...", we focus on how high the stacks are.

Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['gray cylinder', 'pink cylinder', 'cyan cylinder']. This is 3 cylinders high.
Based on States 5-7, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['green cylinder', 'brown cylinder', 'purple cylinder']. This is 3 cylinders high.

Because there are 2 stacks and the tallest stack is 3 cylinders high, we assume that each stack needs to be at most 3 cylinders high.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders. However, the maximum height of a stack is 3.
