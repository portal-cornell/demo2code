==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan cylinder' to the right of 'red cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue cylinder' on top of 'red cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.
* At state 6, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'purple cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all cylinders, where enforcing the maximum stack height...", we focus on how high the stacks are.

Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['cyan cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'blue cylinder']. This is 3 cylinders high.
Based on States 5-6, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['purple cylinder', 'brown cylinder']. This is 2 cylinders high.

Because there are 2 stacks and the tallest stack is 3 cylinders high, we assume that each stack needs to be at most 3 cylinders high.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders. However, the maximum height of a stack is 3.
