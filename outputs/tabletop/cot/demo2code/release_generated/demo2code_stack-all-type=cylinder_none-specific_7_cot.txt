==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray cylinder' is not on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the task is "Stack all cylinders, where enforcing the maximum stack height...", we focus on how high the stacks are.

Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['green cylinder', 'gray cylinder', 'yellow cylinder']. This is 3 cylinders high.

Because there is only 1 stack and the stack is 3 cylinders high, we assume that the maximum height of the stack is 3.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders. However, the maximum height of the stack is 3.
