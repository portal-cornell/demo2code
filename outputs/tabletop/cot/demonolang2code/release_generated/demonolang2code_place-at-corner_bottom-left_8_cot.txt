==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('blue cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue cylinder' to the bottom left corner.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
With only 1 scenario, we assume that the 'blue cylinder' must always be moved to the bottom left corner.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the blue cylinder to the bottom left corner.
