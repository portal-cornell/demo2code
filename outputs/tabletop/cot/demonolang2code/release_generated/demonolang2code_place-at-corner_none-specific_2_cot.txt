==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('blue cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue cylinder' to the bottom left corner.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because two scenarios have two different target positions for the 'blue cylinder' ('bottom left corner', 'top right corner'), we assume that the 'blue cylinder' can be placed at any random corner. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the blue cylinder at any random corner.
