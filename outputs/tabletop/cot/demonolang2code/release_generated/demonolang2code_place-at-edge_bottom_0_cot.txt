==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray cylinder' is not on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray cylinder' to the 'bottom edge' and placed it in front of 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, the 'gray cylinder' needs to be moved to the 'bottom edge' and placed in front of the 'pink cylinder'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the gray cylinder to the bottom edge and place it in front of the pink cylinder.
