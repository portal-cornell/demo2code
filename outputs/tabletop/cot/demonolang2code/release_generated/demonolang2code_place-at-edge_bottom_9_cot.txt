==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('yellow block' is behind 'pink block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' in front of 'yellow block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
With only 1 scenario, we assume that the 'pink block' must always be placed in front of the 'yellow block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the pink block in front of the yellow block.
