==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('blue block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue block' to the 'top edge'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, the robot only needs to move the 'blue block' to the 'top edge' in one scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the blue block to the top edge.
