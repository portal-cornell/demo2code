==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' is in front of 'blue cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue cylinder' and placed it behind 'brown block' and in front of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, the 'blue cylinder' needs to be placed behind the 'brown block' and in front of the 'red block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the blue cylinder behind the brown block and in front of the red block.
