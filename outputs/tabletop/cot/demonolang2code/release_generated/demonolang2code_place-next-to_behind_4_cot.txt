==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the given trajectory, there is only one action performed in this scenario, which is moving the 'purple block'. There is no additional information to infer any specific task specification.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the purple block.
