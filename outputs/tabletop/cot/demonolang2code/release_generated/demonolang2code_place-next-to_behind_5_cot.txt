==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green block' to the 'top edge' and placed it behind 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, the 'green block' needs to be placed behind the 'pink cylinder' at the 'top edge'. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the green block behind the pink cylinder at the top edge.
