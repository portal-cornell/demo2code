==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown block' behind 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, the robot moved the 'brown block' behind the 'red block'. There is no indication of any other blocks or specific positions.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the brown block behind the red block.
