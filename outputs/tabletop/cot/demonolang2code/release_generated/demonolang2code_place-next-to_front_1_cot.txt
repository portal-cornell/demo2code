==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' is behind 'gray cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray cylinder' in front of 'green block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, the robot needs to move the 'gray cylinder' in front of the 'green block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the gray cylinder in front of the green block.
