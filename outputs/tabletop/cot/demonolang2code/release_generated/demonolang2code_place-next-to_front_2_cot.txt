==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' is behind 'green cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Since there is only one scenario provided, there is no additional information to infer from. We can simply state the action performed in the scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the green cylinder.
