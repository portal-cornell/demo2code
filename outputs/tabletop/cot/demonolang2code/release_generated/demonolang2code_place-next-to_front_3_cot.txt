==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'red block' to the 'bottom edge' and placed it in front of 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, the robot moved the 'red block' to the 'bottom edge' and placed it in front of the 'pink cylinder'. There is no additional information or repetition in the trajectory.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the red block to the bottom edge and place it in front of the pink cylinder.
