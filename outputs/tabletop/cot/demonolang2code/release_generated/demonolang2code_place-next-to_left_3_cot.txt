==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' is to the right of 'brown cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' to the left of 'brown cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' behind 'yellow cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the objects from bottom to top are ['brown cylinder', 'brown block', 'brown cylinder'].

Because there are two 'brown cylinder' objects in the stack, we assume that the robot needs to move the 'brown cylinder' twice.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the brown cylinder twice. 
Place the brown block to the left of the brown cylinder.
Place the brown cylinder behind the yellow cylinder.
