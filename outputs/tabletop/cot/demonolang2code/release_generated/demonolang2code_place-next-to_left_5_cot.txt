==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block'.
* The robot placed 'cyan block' to the left of 'purple block', behind 'gray cylinder', with 'purple block' to the right and 'gray cylinder' in front.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, the robot needs to place the 'cyan block' in a specific position relative to the 'purple block' and 'gray cylinder'. The relative positions are: 'cyan block' to the left of 'purple block', behind 'gray cylinder', with 'purple block' to the right and 'gray cylinder' in front.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the cyan block to the left of the purple block, behind the gray cylinder, with the purple block to the right and the gray cylinder in front.
