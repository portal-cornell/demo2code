==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' is to the left of 'pink cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink cylinder' to the right edge, making it to the right of 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In [Scenario 1], the 'pink cylinder' is moved to the right edge, making it to the right of 'cyan block'. 
In [Scenario 2], the 'pink cylinder' is moved, but there is no mention of its position relative to the 'cyan block'.

Since there is no consistent information about the relative position of the 'pink cylinder' and 'cyan block' across scenarios, we cannot make any assumptions about their relationship.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the pink cylinder.
