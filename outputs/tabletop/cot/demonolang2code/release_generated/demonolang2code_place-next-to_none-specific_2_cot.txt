==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' is in front of 'orange cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In [Scenario 1], the robot only moves the 'orange cylinder' without any specific placement.
In [Scenario 2], the robot moves the 'orange cylinder' to the right of the 'yellow cylinder'.

Because the 'orange cylinder' is always moved in both scenarios, we assume that it can be moved to any position without any specific placement.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the orange cylinder to any position.
