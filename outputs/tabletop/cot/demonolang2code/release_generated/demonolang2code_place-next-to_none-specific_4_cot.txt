==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown block' behind 'cyan cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because two scenarios have two different relative positions between 'brown block' and 'cyan cylinder', we assume that the 'brown block' can be anywhere next to or behind 'cyan cylinder'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the brown block at anywhere next to or behind the cyan cylinder.
