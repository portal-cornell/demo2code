==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' is in front of 'red cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'red cylinder'.

* In [Scenario 2], at state 2, the robot moved 'red cylinder' behind 'yellow cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because the 'red cylinder' is moved in both scenarios, we assume that the 'red cylinder' can be moved to any position.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the red cylinder to any position.
