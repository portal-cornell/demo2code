==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' is to the right of 'pink cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink cylinder' to the left of 'pink block'.

The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' is in front of 'pink cylinder').

[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 2], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink cylinder' behind 'pink block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Because two scenarios have two different relative positions between 'pink cylinder' and 'pink block', we assume that the 'pink cylinder' can be anywhere next to or behind 'pink block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the pink cylinder to a position next to or behind the pink block.
