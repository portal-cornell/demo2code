==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' is to the right of 'pink block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In [Scenario 1], the robot simply moves the 'pink block'.
In [Scenario 2], the robot moves the 'pink block' to the left of the 'brown cylinder'.

Because the 'pink block' is always involved in the movement, we assume that the 'pink block' can be moved to any position.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the pink block to any position.
