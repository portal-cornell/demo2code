==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' is to the right of 'pink cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink cylinder'.
* The robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' to the left of 'orange block' and to the right of 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectory, the 'pink cylinder' needs to be placed to the left of 'orange block' and to the right of 'cyan block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Place the pink cylinder to the left of the orange block and to the right of the cyan block.
