==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple cylinder' on top of 'purple block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 2, the robot moved the 'gray cylinder'.
Based on State 3, the robot placed the 'purple cylinder' on top of the 'purple block'.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the gray cylinder and place the purple cylinder on top of the purple block.
