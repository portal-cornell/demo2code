==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'gray cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 2, the robot moved the 'pink block'.
Based on State 3, the robot picked up and placed the 'cyan block' on top of the 'gray cylinder'.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the pink block and place the cyan block on top of the gray cylinder.
