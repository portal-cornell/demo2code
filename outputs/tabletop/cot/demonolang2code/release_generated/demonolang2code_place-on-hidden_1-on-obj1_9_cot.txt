==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' to the right of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'pink block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to place the 'red block' to the right of the 'green cylinder' and then place the 'green cylinder' on top of the 'pink block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Place the red block to the right of the green cylinder.
2. Place the green cylinder on top of the pink block.
