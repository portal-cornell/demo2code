==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'orange block'.
* At state 4, the robot moved 'blue cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, the robot needs to move 'gray block', 'orange block', and 'blue cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'.

[[Task Specification:]]
Move the gray block, orange block, and blue cylinder on top of the yellow cylinder.
