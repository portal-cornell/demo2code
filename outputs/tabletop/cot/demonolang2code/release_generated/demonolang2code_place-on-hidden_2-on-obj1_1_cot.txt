==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' is behind 'brown cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown cylinder' and placed it on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'green cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, the robot needs to place the 'brown cylinder' and 'cyan cylinder' on top of the 'table' before placing the 'orange block' on top of the 'green cylinder'.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Place the brown cylinder on top of the table.
2. Place the cyan cylinder on top of the table.
3. Place the orange block on top of the green cylinder.
