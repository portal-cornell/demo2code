==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, the robot needs to place 'cyan block', 'red block', and 'pink cylinder' on top of the 'table'. 

[[Task Specification:]]
Place the cyan block, red block, and pink cylinder on top of the table.
