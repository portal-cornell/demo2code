==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('yellow cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'yellow cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'red cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'green block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot moved both 'yellow cylinder' and 'red cylinder' in the same order.

Based on State 4, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'green block'.

[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the yellow cylinder.
2. Move the red cylinder.
3. Place the cyan block on top of the green block.
