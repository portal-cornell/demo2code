==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'red cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, the robot needs to move the 'gray block' before placing the 'yellow block' on top of the 'table'. Then, it needs to place the 'blue block' on top of the 'red cylinder'.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the gray block.
2. Place the yellow block on top of the table.
3. Place the blue block on top of the red cylinder.
