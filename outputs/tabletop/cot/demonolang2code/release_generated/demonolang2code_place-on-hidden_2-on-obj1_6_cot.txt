==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'gray block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'brown cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, the robot needs to place the 'cyan cylinder' on top of the 'table', then place the 'gray block' on top of the 'table', and finally place the 'orange cylinder' on top of the 'brown cylinder'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Place the cyan cylinder on top of the table.
2. Place the gray block on top of the table.
3. Place the orange cylinder on top of the brown cylinder.
