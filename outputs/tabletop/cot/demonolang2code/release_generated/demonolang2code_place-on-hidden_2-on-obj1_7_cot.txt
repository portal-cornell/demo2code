==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'red cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, the robot needs to move the 'red cylinder' and place the 'brown cylinder' on top of the 'red block'. The 'purple block' is placed on top of the 'table' but it is not related to the other actions.

[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the red cylinder.
2. Place the brown cylinder on top of the red block.
