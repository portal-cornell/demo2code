==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, the robot needs to place the 'green cylinder' on top of the 'table', then place the 'cyan block' on top of the 'table', and finally place the 'orange cylinder' on top of the 'cyan cylinder'.

[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Place the green cylinder on top of the table.
2. Place the cyan block on top of the table.
3. Place the orange cylinder on top of the cyan cylinder.
