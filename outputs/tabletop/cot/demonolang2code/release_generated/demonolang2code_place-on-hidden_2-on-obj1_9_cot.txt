==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'blue cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, the robot needs to move the 'green cylinder' and then place the 'pink block' on the table. After that, it needs to pick up the 'yellow block' and place it on top of the 'blue cylinder'.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the green cylinder.
2. Place the pink block on the table.
3. Pick up the yellow block.
4. Place the yellow block on top of the blue cylinder.
