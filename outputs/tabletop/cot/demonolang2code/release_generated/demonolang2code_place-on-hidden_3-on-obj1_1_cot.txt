==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'red cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 4, the robot moved 'orange block'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'purple cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectories, there is no clear pattern or repetition. Each action is unique and does not follow a specific order or relationship.
[[Task Specification:]]
Perform the following actions in the given order:
1. Move the red cylinder.
2. Move the pink cylinder.
3. Move the orange block.
4. Place the brown block on top of the purple cylinder.
