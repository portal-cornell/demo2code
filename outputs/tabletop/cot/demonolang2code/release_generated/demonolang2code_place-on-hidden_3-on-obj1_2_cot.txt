==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple cylinder' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'table'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, the robot needs to move the 'purple cylinder' and then place the 'green block' and 'blue block' on top of the 'table'. Finally, it needs to place the 'orange cylinder' on top of the 'cyan block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the purple cylinder.
2. Place the green block on top of the table.
3. Place the blue block on top of the table.
4. Place the orange cylinder on top of the cyan block.
