==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange block' to the right of 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'brown block'.
* At state 4, the robot moved 'green block'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, the order of the subtasks is as follows:
1. Move 'orange block' to the right of 'pink cylinder'
2. Move 'brown block'
3. Move 'green block'
4. Place 'purple block' on top of 'pink cylinder'

There is no repetition or loop in the subtasks.
[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Move 'orange block' to the right of 'pink cylinder'
2. Move 'brown block'
3. Move 'green block'
4. Place 'purple block' on top of 'pink cylinder'
