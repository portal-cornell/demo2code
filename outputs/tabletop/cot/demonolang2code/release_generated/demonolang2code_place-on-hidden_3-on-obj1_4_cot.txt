==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green block'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'blue block'.
* At state 4, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'cyan cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on the trajectories, there is no clear pattern or repetition. Each action is unique and does not follow a specific order or relationship.
[[Task Specification:]]
Perform the following actions in the given order:
1. Move the green block.
2. Move the blue block.
3. Move the green cylinder.
4. Place the brown block on top of the cyan cylinder.
