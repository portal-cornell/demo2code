==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red block' is to the right of 'yellow cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'yellow cylinder' and placed it to the left of 'red block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot moved 'green cylinder' and placed it behind 'red block' on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'orange block' and placed it on top of 'table'. 
* At state 5, the robot moved 'gray block' and placed it on top of 'gray cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, the robot needs to move the 'yellow cylinder', 'green cylinder', and 'orange block' to the table in that order. 
Based on State 5, the robot needs to move the 'gray block' and place it on top of the 'gray cylinder'.

[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the yellow cylinder and place it to the left of the red block on top of the table.
2. Move the green cylinder and place it behind the red block on top of the table.
3. Move the orange block and place it on top of the table.
4. Move the gray block and place it on top of the gray cylinder.
