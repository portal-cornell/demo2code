==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' is to the right of 'brown cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown cylinder' and placed it on top of 'table'. 
* At state 3, the robot moved 'red cylinder' and placed it on top of 'table'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'orange block' and placed it on top of 'table'. 
* At state 5, the robot moved 'pink block' and placed it on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, the robot needs to move objects ('brown cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'orange block', 'pink block') to the table. The order of the objects being moved to the table is ['brown cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'orange block', 'pink block'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the objects ['brown cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'orange block', 'pink block'] to the table in the given order.
