==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' behind 'green block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move the 'brown block' and place the 'yellow block' behind the 'green block'.
Based on States 4-5, the robot needs to move the 'green cylinder' and place the 'pink cylinder' on top of the 'yellow cylinder'.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the brown block.
2. Place the yellow block behind the green block.
3. Move the green cylinder.
4. Place the pink cylinder on top of the yellow cylinder.
