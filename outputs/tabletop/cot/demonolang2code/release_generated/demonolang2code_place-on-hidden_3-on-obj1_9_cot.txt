==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' is on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink block'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'yellow block' and placed it in front of 'brown cylinder'.
* At state 4, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'green block' and placed it on top of 'purple cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, the subtasks are as follows:
1. Move 'pink block'
2. Move 'yellow block' and place it in front of 'brown cylinder'
3. Move 'gray cylinder'
4. Move 'green block' and place it on top of 'purple cylinder'

There is no repetition or loop in the subtasks.
[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Move 'pink block'
2. Move 'yellow block' and place it in front of 'brown cylinder'
3. Move 'gray cylinder'
4. Move 'green block' and place it on top of 'purple cylinder'
