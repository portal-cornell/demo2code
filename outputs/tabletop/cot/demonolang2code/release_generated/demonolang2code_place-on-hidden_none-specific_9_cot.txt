==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' is not on top of 'table'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple block' and placed it on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 2, the robot moved the 'purple block' and placed it on top of the 'red block'. There is no other information or trajectory provided.

[[Task Specification:]]
Move the purple block and place it on top of the red block.
