==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'green block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'pink block'. 
* At state 5, the robot moved 'red cylinder'. 
* At state 6, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'red cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 8, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'orange cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['green block', 'pink block', 'blue block'].
Based on States 5-8, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['red cylinder', 'gray cylinder', 'orange cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'].

Because there are 2 stacks and the tallest stack is 4 blocks high, we assume that each stack needs to be at most 4 blocks high.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks and cylinders. However, the maximum height of a stack is 4.
