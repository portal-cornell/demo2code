==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' on top of 'green block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'green block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'green block'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'yellow cylinder'. 
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'blue cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'. 
* At state 8, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'. 
* At state 9, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['green block', 'red block', 'pink block', 'yellow block'].
Based on States 6-9, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['yellow cylinder', 'blue cylinder', 'green cylinder', 'pink cylinder'].

Because the blocks and cylinders are stacked separately, we assume that the blocks and cylinders should be stacked independently.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into one stack and stack all cylinders into another stack. The order of stacking within each stack doesn't matter.
