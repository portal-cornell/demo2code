==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('yellow block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'yellow block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'gray block' on top of 'purple block'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'. 
* At state 6, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'purple cylinder'. 
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['yellow block', 'purple block', 'gray block'].
Based on States 5-7, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['purple cylinder', 'green cylinder', 'pink cylinder'].

Because there are 2 stacks and the tallest stack is 3 blocks high, we assume that each stack needs to be at most 3 blocks high.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks and cylinders. However, the maximum height of a stack is 3.
