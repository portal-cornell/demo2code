==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'purple block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 6, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'blue cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to stack 'pink block' on top of 'purple block'.
Based on States 4-7, the robot needs to stack 'pink cylinder', 'brown cylinder', and 'blue cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.

Because the blocks and cylinders are stacked separately, we assume that the blocks and cylinders should be stacked in their respective groups.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Stack the pink block on top of the purple block.
2. Stack the pink cylinder, brown cylinder, and blue cylinder on top of the gray cylinder.
