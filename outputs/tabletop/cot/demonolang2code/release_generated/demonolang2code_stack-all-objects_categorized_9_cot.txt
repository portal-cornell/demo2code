==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block' behind 'blue block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'purple block'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'blue block' on top of 'cyan block' and 'green block'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'. 
* At state 8, the robot picked up and placed 'purple cylinder' on top of 'orange cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['cyan block', 'purple block', 'green block'].
Based on States 6-8, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['pink cylinder', 'orange cylinder', 'purple cylinder'].

Because there are two separate stacks, one for blocks and one for cylinders, we assume that the blocks and cylinders should be stacked separately.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into one stack and all cylinders into another stack.
