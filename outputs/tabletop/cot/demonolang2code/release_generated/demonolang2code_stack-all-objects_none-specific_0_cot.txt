==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' is to the left of 'yellow cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'yellow cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'purple cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'yellow block'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'gray cylinder'. 
* At state 8, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'pink block'. 
* At state 9, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the objects from bottom to top are ['yellow cylinder', 'purple cylinder', 'yellow block', 'cyan block'].
Based on States 6-9, in the second stack, the objects from bottom to top are ['gray cylinder', 'pink block', 'pink cylinder', 'orange block'].

Because there are 2 stacks and the objects in each stack are different, we assume that each stack is independent and doesn't have any specific order.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all objects into two independent stacks.
