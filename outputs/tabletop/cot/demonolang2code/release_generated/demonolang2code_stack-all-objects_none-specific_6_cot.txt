==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'red cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'cyan block'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'green block' and placed it behind 'brown cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' on top of 'green block'. 
* At state 8, the robot moved 'brown cylinder' and placed it on top of 'green block' and 'red block'.
* At state 9, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'green block', 'red block', and 'brown cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the objects from bottom to top are ['green cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'cyan block', 'orange block'].
Based on States 6-9, in the second stack, the objects from bottom to top are ['green block', 'red block', 'brown cylinder', 'pink cylinder'].

Because there are two stacks and the objects in each stack are different, we assume that each stack needs to be built separately.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Stack the objects in the first stack: 'green cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'cyan block', 'orange block'.
2. Stack the objects in the second stack: 'green block', 'red block', 'brown cylinder', 'pink cylinder'.
