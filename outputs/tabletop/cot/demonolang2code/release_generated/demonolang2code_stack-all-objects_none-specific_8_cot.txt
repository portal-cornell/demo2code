==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'orange cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue cylinder' on top of 'brown block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'cyan cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'cyan cylinder'. 
* At state 8, the robot picked up and placed 'gray block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 9, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'gray block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the objects from bottom to top are ['orange cylinder', 'brown block', 'blue cylinder', 'red cylinder'].
Based on States 6-9, in the second stack, the objects from bottom to top are ['cyan cylinder', 'cyan block', 'gray block', 'purple block'].

Because there are 2 stacks and the objects in each stack are different, we assume that each stack needs to be built separately.
[[Task Specification:]]
Build two stacks of objects. Each stack should be built separately.
