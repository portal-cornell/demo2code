==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'red cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'yellow block'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'yellow cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'yellow cylinder'. 
* At state 8, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'brown block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the objects from bottom to top are ['green cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'yellow block', 'pink cylinder'].
Based on States 6-8, in the second stack, the objects from bottom to top are ['yellow cylinder', 'brown block', 'purple block'].

Because there are two separate stacks, we assume that the objects in each stack are independent of each other.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the objects in each stack independently.
