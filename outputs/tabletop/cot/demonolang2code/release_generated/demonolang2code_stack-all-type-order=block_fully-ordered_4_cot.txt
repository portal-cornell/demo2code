==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['cyan block', 'pink block', 'blue block', 'brown block'].

Because the blocks are stacked on top of the same block ('cyan block'), we assume that the robot needs to stack multiple blocks on top of the same base block.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack multiple blocks on top of the same base block.
