==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' is to the left of 'blue block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown block'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'blue block'.
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'gray block' on top of 'blue block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'gray block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['brown block', 'blue block', 'gray block', 'purple block'].
Based on States 2-5 in [Scenario 2], the blocks from bottom to top is ['blue block', 'gray block', 'brown block', 'purple block'].

The order of blocks in both scenarios is ['brown block', 'blue block', 'gray block', 'purple block'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into one stack. Also make sure that the stacking enforces the bottom to top order between these objects: ['brown block', 'blue block', 'gray block', 'purple block'].
