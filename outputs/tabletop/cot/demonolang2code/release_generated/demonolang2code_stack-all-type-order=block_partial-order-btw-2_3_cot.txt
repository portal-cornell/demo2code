==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'green block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'blue block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'pink block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In both scenarios, the blocks are stacked in the same order: 'green block', 'blue block', 'pink block', 'purple block'. 

[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the blocks in the following order: 'green block', 'blue block', 'pink block', 'purple block'.
