==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' is to the right of 'green block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'green block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'blue block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5 in both scenarios, the blocks are stacked in the following order: ['green block', 'blue block', 'cyan block', 'pink block'].

Because the order of the blocks remains the same in both scenarios, we can assume that the order of the blocks is fixed.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the blocks in the following order: ['green block', 'blue block', 'cyan block', 'pink block'].
