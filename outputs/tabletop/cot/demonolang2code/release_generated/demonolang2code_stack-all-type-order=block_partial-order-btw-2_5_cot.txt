==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' is in front of 'gray block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'blue block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In [Scenario 1], based on States 2-5, the blocks are stacked as follows: ['gray block', 'cyan block', 'blue block', 'orange block'].
In [Scenario 2], based on States 2-5, the blocks are stacked as follows: ['orange block', 'cyan block', 'blue block', 'gray block'].

The only difference between the two scenarios is the starting block. The rest of the stacking order remains the same.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks in the following order: ['gray block', 'cyan block', 'blue block', 'orange block'].
