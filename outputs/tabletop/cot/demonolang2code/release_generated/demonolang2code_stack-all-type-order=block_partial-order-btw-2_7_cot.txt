==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' on top of 'blue block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In [Scenario 1], based on States 2-5, the blocks are stacked in the order ['gray block', 'blue block', 'red block', 'yellow block'].
In [Scenario 2], based on States 2-5, the blocks are stacked in the order ['yellow block', 'gray block', 'blue block', 'red block'].

The common ordering between the two scenarios is ['gray block', 'blue block', 'red block'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into one stack. Also make sure that the stacking enforces the bottom to top order between these objects: ['gray block', 'blue block', 'red block'].
