==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' on top of 'orange block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'orange block'. 
* At state 5, the robot moved 'brown block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In both scenarios, the robot needs to stack the blocks in the order of 'orange block', 'red block', 'blue block'. However, the starting position of the blocks may vary.

[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the orange block.
2. Place the red block on top of the orange block.
3. Place the blue block on top of the orange block.
