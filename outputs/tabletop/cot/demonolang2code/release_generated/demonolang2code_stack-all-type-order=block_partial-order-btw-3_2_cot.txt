==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' is to the left of 'yellow block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'yellow block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'gray block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'yellow block'.

* In [Scenario 2], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'green block' behind 'purple block'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'green block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In [Scenario 1], based on States 2-5, the blocks stacked on top of 'yellow block' are ['gray block', 'purple block', 'green block'].
In [Scenario 2], based on States 2-5, the blocks stacked on top of 'gray block' are ['purple block', 'green block', 'yellow block'].

Between the two scenarios, the ordering of the blocks on top of the base block ('yellow block' or 'gray block') is the same: ['gray block', 'purple block', 'green block'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks on top of the base block. The ordering of the blocks on top of the base block should be: ['gray block', 'purple block', 'green block'].
