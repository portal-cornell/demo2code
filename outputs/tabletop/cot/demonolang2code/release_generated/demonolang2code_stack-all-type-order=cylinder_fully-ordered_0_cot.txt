==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' is to the left of 'green cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'brown cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['green cylinder', 'gray cylinder', 'brown cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'].

Because the order of the cylinders stays the same in all scenarios, we assume that the order of the cylinders is fixed.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders in the order: ['green cylinder', 'gray cylinder', 'brown cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'].
