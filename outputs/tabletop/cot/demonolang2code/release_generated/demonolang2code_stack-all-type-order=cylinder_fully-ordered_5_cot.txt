==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'purple cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'red cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['purple cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'yellow cylinder', 'cyan cylinder'].

Because the order of the cylinders stays the same in all scenarios, we assume that the order of the cylinders is fixed.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders in the fixed order: ['purple cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'yellow cylinder', 'cyan cylinder'].
