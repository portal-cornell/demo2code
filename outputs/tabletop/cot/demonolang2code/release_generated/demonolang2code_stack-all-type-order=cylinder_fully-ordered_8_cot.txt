==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'blue cylinder' at 'left edge' on top of 'green cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, the robot always moves the 'green cylinder' and then places other cylinders on top of it. Additionally, in State 5, the robot specifically places the 'blue cylinder' at the 'left edge' on top of the 'green cylinder'.

[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Move the green cylinder.
2. Place the brown cylinder on top of the green cylinder.
3. Place the pink cylinder on top of the green cylinder.
4. Place the blue cylinder at the left edge on top of the green cylinder.
