==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' is to the left of 'pink cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple cylinder' on top of 'orange cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5 in both scenarios, the order of the cylinders being stacked is ['pink cylinder', 'cyan cylinder', 'orange cylinder', 'purple cylinder'].

Because the order of the cylinders being stacked is the same in both scenarios, we can assume that the order is fixed and does not need to be changed.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the cylinders in the order: ['pink cylinder', 'cyan cylinder', 'orange cylinder', 'purple cylinder'].
