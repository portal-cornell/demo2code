==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'gray cylinder' and placed it on top of 'green cylinder', 'brown cylinder', and 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In both scenarios, the robot first moves the 'green cylinder' and then stacks other cylinders on top of it. The order of the other cylinders being stacked is ['pink cylinder', 'brown cylinder', 'gray cylinder'].

Because the order of stacking the cylinders is the same in both scenarios, we can use a loop to handle the stacking of the cylinders.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the green cylinder.
2. Stack the cylinders ['pink cylinder', 'brown cylinder', 'gray cylinder'] on top of the green cylinder using a loop.
