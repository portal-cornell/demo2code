==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In [Scenario 1], based on States 2-5, the order of cylinders on top of the 'cyan cylinder' is ['yellow cylinder', 'gray cylinder', 'green cylinder'].
In [Scenario 2], based on States 2-5, the order of cylinders on top of the 'yellow cylinder' is ['gray cylinder', 'green cylinder', 'cyan cylinder'].

Between the two scenarios, the ordering that stays the same is ['gray cylinder', 'green cylinder'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders on top of the 'cyan cylinder'. Also make sure that the stacking enforces the bottom to top order between these cylinders: ['gray cylinder', 'green cylinder'].
