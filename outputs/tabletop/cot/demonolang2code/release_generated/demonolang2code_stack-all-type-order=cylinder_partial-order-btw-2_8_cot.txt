==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('blue cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'purple cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In both scenarios, the robot is stacking cylinders in a specific order: 'blue cylinder', 'purple cylinder', 'cyan cylinder', 'pink cylinder'. The order remains the same in both scenarios.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the cylinders in the following order: 'blue cylinder', 'purple cylinder', 'cyan cylinder', 'pink cylinder'.
