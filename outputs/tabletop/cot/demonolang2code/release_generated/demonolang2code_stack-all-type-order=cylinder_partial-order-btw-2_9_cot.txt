==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'blue cylinder' on top of 'brown cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In both scenarios, the robot starts by moving the 'cyan cylinder'. Then, in both scenarios, the robot stacks the cylinders in the order of ['brown cylinder', 'blue cylinder', 'gray cylinder'].

Based on this, we can conclude that the robot needs to move the 'cyan cylinder' first, and then stack the cylinders in the order of ['brown cylinder', 'blue cylinder', 'gray cylinder'].
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the cyan cylinder.
2. Stack the cylinders in the order of ['brown cylinder', 'blue cylinder', 'gray cylinder'].
