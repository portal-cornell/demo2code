==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' is to the left of 'pink cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'blue cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In [Scenario 1], based on States 2-5, the pink cylinder is the base and the other cylinders ('brown cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'blue cylinder') are stacked on top of it.
In [Scenario 2], based on States 2-5, the blue cylinder is the base and the other cylinders ('pink cylinder', 'brown cylinder', 'red cylinder') are stacked on top of it.

Because the base cylinder changes between the two scenarios, we assume that the base cylinder can be any of the given cylinders.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders. The base cylinder can be any of the given cylinders.
