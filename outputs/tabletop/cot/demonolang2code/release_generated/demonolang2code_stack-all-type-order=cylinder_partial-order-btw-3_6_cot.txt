==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'blue cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In [Scenario 1], based on States 2-5, the 'gray cylinder' is the base and the other cylinders ('yellow cylinder', 'brown cylinder', 'blue cylinder') are stacked on top of it.
In [Scenario 2], based on States 2-5, the 'yellow cylinder' is the base and the other cylinders ('brown cylinder', 'blue cylinder', 'gray cylinder') are stacked on top of it.

Between the two scenarios, the only difference is the base cylinder. Therefore, we can use a loop to handle the stacking of the cylinders on top of the base cylinder.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Set the base cylinder as the current cylinder.
2. Loop through the remaining cylinders and stack each one on top of the current cylinder.
