==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange cylinder' is to the right of 'green cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'orange cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
In both scenarios, the robot needs to stack the cylinders in the order of ['green cylinder', 'orange cylinder', 'pink cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'].

[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the cylinders in the order of ['green cylinder', 'orange cylinder', 'pink cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'].
