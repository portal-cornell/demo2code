==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory is incomplete as it only contains the scenario and the state number. There is no information about the actions or the state predicates. Therefore, it cannot be summarized further.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
no
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
N/A

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red block' is in front of 'purple cylinder'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 2], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'purple cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'brown cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'red cylinder'.

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
There is no input trajectory provided. Therefore, there is nothing to summarize.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
N/A
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
N/A

==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory is already in the form of low-level actions, so there is no need to summarize it further.
The new trajectory is already sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 2], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown cylinder' on top of 'purple cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'brown cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'red cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Since there is only one scenario provided, we cannot determine any repetition or loop in the subtasks.
[[Task Specification:]]
In [Scenario 2], stack the cylinders in the following order: 'purple cylinder', 'brown cylinder', 'red cylinder', 'orange cylinder'.
