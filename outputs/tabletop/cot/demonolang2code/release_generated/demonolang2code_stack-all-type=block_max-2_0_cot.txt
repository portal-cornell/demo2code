==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown block' to the left of 'red block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'brown block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'red block' to the right of 'brown block'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the blocks from left to right is ['brown block', 'orange block', 'red block'].

Because the blocks need to be arranged from left to right, we assume that the order of blocks matters.
[[Task Specification:]]
Arrange the blocks from left to right in the following order: 'brown block', 'orange block', 'red block'.
