==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'blue block' on top of 'green block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'pink block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move 'green block' and place 'blue block' on top of it. 
Based on State 4, the robot needs to move 'pink block'.

There is no repetition or loop in the subtasks. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Move the green block.
2. Place the blue block on top of the green block.
3. Move the pink block.
