==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'purple block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'blue block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['purple block', 'pink block'].
Based on State 4, the robot moved the 'blue block' separately.

Because the 'blue block' is moved separately from the stack, we assume that it is not related to the stacking task.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the 'purple block' and 'pink block' on top of each other.
