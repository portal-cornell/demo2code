==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'red block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'red block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'purple block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move 'red block' and place 'pink block' on top of it. 
Based on State 4, the robot needs to move 'purple block'.

There is no repetition or loop in the subtasks.
[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Move the red block.
2. Place the pink block on top of the red block.
3. Move the purple block.
