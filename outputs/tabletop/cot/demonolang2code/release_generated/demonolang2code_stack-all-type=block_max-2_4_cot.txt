==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'green block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['cyan block', 'orange block'].
Based on State 4, the robot moved the 'green block' but did not place it on top of any other block.

Since there is no indication of any further actions involving the blocks, we assume that the task is to only stack the 'cyan block' and 'orange block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the cyan block and orange block.
