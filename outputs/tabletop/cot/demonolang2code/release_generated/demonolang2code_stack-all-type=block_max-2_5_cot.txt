==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['gray block', 'yellow block'].
Based on State 4, the robot moved 'cyan block' without any specific placement.

Because there is no specific placement for 'cyan block', we assume that it can be moved freely without any constraints.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the gray block and yellow block. The cyan block can be moved freely.
