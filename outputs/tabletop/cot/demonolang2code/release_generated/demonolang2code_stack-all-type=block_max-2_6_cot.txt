==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' is to the right of 'purple block'). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'red block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['cyan block', 'pink block'].
Based on States 4-5, in the second stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['red block', 'purple block'].

Because there are two separate stacks, we assume that the blocks in each stack are independent of each other.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the blocks in two separate stacks.
