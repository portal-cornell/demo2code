==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple block' in front of 'orange block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'purple block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'pink block'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'red block' on top of 'pink block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move 'purple block' in front of 'orange block' and then place 'orange block' on top of 'purple block'.
Based on States 4-5, the robot needs to move 'pink block' and then place 'red block' on top of 'pink block'.

The order of the subtasks is the same in both scenarios.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the purple block in front of the orange block.
2. Place the orange block on top of the purple block.
3. Move the pink block.
4. Place the red block on top of the pink block.
