==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink block' behind 'cyan block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'pink block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move 'pink block' behind 'cyan block' and then place 'purple block' on top of 'pink block'. 

Based on State 4, the robot needs to move 'cyan block' again. 

Therefore, the robot needs to repeat the process of moving 'pink block' behind 'cyan block' and placing 'purple block' on top of 'pink block' multiple times. 
[[Task Specification:]]
Repeat the following steps until the desired condition is met:
1. Move the pink block behind the cyan block.
2. Place the purple block on top of the pink block.
3. Move the cyan block.
