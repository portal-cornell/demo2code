==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan block' on top of 'orange block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'gray block' on top of 'cyan block'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['orange block', 'cyan block', 'gray block'].

Because there is no further action involving the blocks, we assume that the task is to stack the blocks in the given order.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the blocks in the order: ['orange block', 'cyan block', 'gray block'].
