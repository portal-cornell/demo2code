==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block' in front of 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'gray block' on top of 'cyan block' and 'purple block'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'cyan block', 'purple block', and 'gray block'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'blue block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, the blocks are stacked in the following order: 'cyan block', 'purple block', 'gray block', 'green block'.

Because the blocks are stacked in a specific order, we assume that the blocks need to be stacked in the same order in all scenarios.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the blocks in the following order: 'cyan block', 'purple block', 'gray block', 'green block'.
