==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'brown block'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'yellow block'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'blue block'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'blue block'. 
* At state 8, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'orange block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['gray block', 'brown block', 'yellow block', 'green block'].
Based on States 6-8, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['blue block', 'orange block', 'pink block'].

Because each stack has only blocks and the order of blocks is different in each scenario, we assume that the order of blocks matters.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks into two stacks. The order of blocks in each stack matters.
