==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('yellow block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'yellow block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'yellow block'. 
* At state 6, the robot moved 'blue block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['yellow block', 'pink block', 'orange block', 'purple block'].

Because the blocks are stacked on top of the 'yellow block' in the same order in all scenarios, we can use a loop to handle the stacking of different blocks on top of the 'yellow block'.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks on top of the yellow block in the order they appear.
