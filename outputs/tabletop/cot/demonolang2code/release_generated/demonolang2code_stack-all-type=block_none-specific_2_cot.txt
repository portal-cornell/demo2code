==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan block' behind 'brown block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'cyan block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'cyan block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, the 'cyan block' is used as a base for stacking 'brown block', 'green block', and 'yellow block' on top of it. The order of the blocks being placed on top of the 'cyan block' is ['brown block', 'green block', 'yellow block'].
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the 'brown block', 'green block', and 'yellow block' on top of the 'cyan block' in the given order.
