==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink block' to the right of 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'brown block' on top of 'pink block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on State 2, the robot needs to move the 'pink block' to the right of the 'gray cylinder'. 
Based on State 3, the robot needs to place the 'brown block' on top of the 'pink block'.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the pink block to the right of the gray cylinder. Then, place the brown block on top of the pink block.
