==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow block' on top of 'green block'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'purple block' on top of 'yellow block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['gray block', 'green block', 'yellow block', 'purple block'].

Because the order of blocks in this scenario is consistent, we assume that the order of blocks should be maintained.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all blocks in the order: ['gray block', 'green block', 'yellow block', 'purple block'].
