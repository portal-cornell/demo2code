==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('gray block' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'gray block'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'green block' on top of 'gray block'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'orange block' on top of 'green block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the blocks from bottom to top is ['gray block', 'green block', 'orange block'].

Because there is only one scenario, we assume that the order of the blocks in the stack is fixed.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the blocks in the following order: 'gray block' at the bottom, 'green block' in the middle, and 'orange block' on top.
