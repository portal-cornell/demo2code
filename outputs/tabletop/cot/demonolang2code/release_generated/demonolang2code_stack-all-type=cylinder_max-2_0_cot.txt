==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('red cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'red cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'red cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'pink cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move 'red cylinder' and place 'cyan cylinder' on top of it. Then, at State 4, the robot moves 'pink cylinder'.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the red cylinder and place the cyan cylinder on top of it. Then, move the pink cylinder.
