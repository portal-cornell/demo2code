==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'orange cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['orange cylinder', 'pink cylinder'].
Based on States 4-5, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['gray cylinder', 'red cylinder'].

Because there are two separate stacks, we assume that each stack should have its own set of cylinders.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the cylinders into two separate stacks.
