==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'blue cylinder' on top of 'orange cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move 'orange cylinder' and place 'blue cylinder' on top of it. 
Based on State 4, the robot needs to move 'green cylinder' separately.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Move the orange cylinder.
2. Place the blue cylinder on top of the orange cylinder.
3. Move the green cylinder.
