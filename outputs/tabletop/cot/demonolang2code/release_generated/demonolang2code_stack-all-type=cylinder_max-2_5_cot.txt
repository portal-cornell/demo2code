==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('blue cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'purple cylinder' to the left of 'red block'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to stack 'orange cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'.
Based on State 4, the robot needs to move 'purple cylinder' to the left of 'red block'.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Stack the orange cylinder on top of the blue cylinder.
2. Move the purple cylinder to the left of the red block.
