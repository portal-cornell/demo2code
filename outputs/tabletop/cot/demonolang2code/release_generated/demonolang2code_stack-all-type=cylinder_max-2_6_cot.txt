==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'purple cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move the 'purple cylinder' and place the 'green cylinder' on top of it. 
Based on State 4, the robot needs to move the 'gray cylinder'.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
1. Move the purple cylinder.
2. Place the green cylinder on top of the purple cylinder.
3. Move the gray cylinder.
