==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('blue cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move 'blue cylinder' and place 'red cylinder' on top of it. 
Based on State 4, the robot needs to move 'purple cylinder'.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the blue cylinder and place the red cylinder on top of it. Then, move the purple cylinder.
