==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'red cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move 'pink cylinder' and place 'orange cylinder' on top of it. 
Based on State 4, the robot needs to move 'red cylinder'.

There is no repetition or loop in this scenario.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the pink cylinder and place the orange cylinder on top of it. Then, move the red cylinder.
