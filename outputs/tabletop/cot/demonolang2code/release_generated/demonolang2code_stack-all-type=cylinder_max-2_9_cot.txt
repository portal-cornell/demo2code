==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('blue cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'red cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot moved 'yellow cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'pink cylinder' and placed it on top of 'yellow cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to stack 'red cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'.
Based on States 4-5, the robot needs to stack 'pink cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'.

Because the order of stacking is different for the two scenarios, we assume that the order of stacking is scenario-specific and not repeatable.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the cylinders in the following order:
1. Stack the red cylinder on top of the blue cylinder.
2. Stack the pink cylinder on top of the yellow cylinder.
