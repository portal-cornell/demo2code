==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder' behind 'purple cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot moved 'green block' behind 'green cylinder' and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'.
* At state 4, the robot moved 'blue cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'purple cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-6, the order of the objects being moved and placed is as follows: 'green cylinder', 'green block', 'orange cylinder', 'blue cylinder', 'purple cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'.

[[Task Specification:]]
Specifically:
1. Move the green cylinder behind the purple cylinder.
2. Move the green block behind the green cylinder and place the orange cylinder on top of the green cylinder.
3. Move the blue cylinder on top of the green cylinder.
4. Move the purple cylinder.
5. Move the yellow cylinder on top of the purple cylinder.
