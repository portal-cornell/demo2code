==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('pink cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'pink cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot moved 'red cylinder'. 
* At state 6, the robot picked up and placed 'purple cylinder' on top of 'red cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot moved 'brown cylinder' and placed it on top of 'red cylinder' and 'purple cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['pink cylinder', 'cyan cylinder', 'green cylinder'].
Based on States 5-6, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['red cylinder', 'purple cylinder'].

Because there are 2 stacks and the tallest stack is 3 cylinders high, we assume that each stack needs to be at most 3 cylinders high.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders. However, the maximum height of a stack is 3.
