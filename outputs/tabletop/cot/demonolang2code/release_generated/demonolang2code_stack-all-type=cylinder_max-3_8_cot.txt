==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('cyan cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'cyan cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'cyan cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 6, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['cyan cylinder', 'yellow cylinder', 'gray cylinder'].
Based on States 5-6, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['green cylinder', 'orange cylinder'].

Because there are 2 stacks and the tallest stack is 3 cylinders high, we assume that each stack needs to be at most 3 cylinders high.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders. However, the maximum height of a stack is 3.
