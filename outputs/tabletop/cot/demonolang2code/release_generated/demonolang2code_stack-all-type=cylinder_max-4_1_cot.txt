==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('purple cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'purple cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'purple cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'pink cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'.
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'pink cylinder'. 
* At state 6, the robot moved 'gray cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['purple cylinder', 'yellow cylinder', 'pink cylinder', 'green cylinder'].

Because there is no information about the gray cylinder in the trajectory, we assume that it can be placed anywhere.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders into one stack. The order should be ['purple cylinder', 'yellow cylinder', 'pink cylinder', 'green cylinder']. Place the gray cylinder anywhere.
