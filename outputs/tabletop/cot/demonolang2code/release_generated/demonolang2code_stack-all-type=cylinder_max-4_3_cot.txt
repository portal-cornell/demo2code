==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('brown cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'brown cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'brown cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'cyan cylinder' on top of 'yellow cylinder'.
* At state 6, the robot moved 'blue cylinder'.
* At state 7, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'. 
* At state 8, the robot picked up and placed 'orange cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['brown cylinder', 'gray cylinder', 'yellow cylinder', 'cyan cylinder'].
Based on States 6-8, in the second stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['blue cylinder', 'green cylinder', 'orange cylinder'].

Because each stack only contains cylinders and the order of cylinders is different between the two scenarios, we assume that the order of cylinders matters.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack all cylinders into two stacks. Make sure to maintain the order of cylinders within each stack.
