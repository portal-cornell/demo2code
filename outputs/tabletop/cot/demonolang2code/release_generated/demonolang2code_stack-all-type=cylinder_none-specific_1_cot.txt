==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('orange cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'orange cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'orange cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-4, in the first stack, the cylinders from bottom to top is ['orange cylinder', 'green cylinder', 'gray cylinder'].

Because the order of the cylinders stays the same in this scenario, we assume that the order of the cylinders is fixed.
[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the cylinders in the order: ['orange cylinder', 'green cylinder', 'gray cylinder'].
