==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('blue cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'blue cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'green cylinder' on top of 'blue cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-3, the robot needs to move the 'blue cylinder' and then place the 'green cylinder' on top of it.
[[Task Specification:]]
Move the blue cylinder and place the green cylinder on top of it.
