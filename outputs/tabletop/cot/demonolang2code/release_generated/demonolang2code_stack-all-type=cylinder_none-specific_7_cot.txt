==========================summarizing demo==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
The input trajectory contains state predicates because the trajectory talks about the status of the objects ('green cylinder' has moved). 
I will summarize the state trajectory into low-level actions.
The low-level actions are the most compact form, so I should stop summarizing after this. 
The new trajectory will be sufficiently summarized.
[[Is the new trajectory sufficiently summarized? (yes/no):]]
yes
[[Summarized trajectory:]]
* In [Scenario 1], at state 2, the robot moved 'green cylinder'.
* At state 3, the robot picked up and placed 'gray cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 4, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'green cylinder'. 
* At state 5, the robot picked up and placed 'yellow cylinder' on top of 'gray cylinder'.

==========================summary -> spec==========================
[[Reasoning:]]
Based on States 2-5, we can see that the robot needs to stack the cylinders in a specific order: 'green cylinder', 'gray cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'. 

[[Task Specification:]]
Stack the cylinders in the following order: 'green cylinder', 'gray cylinder', 'yellow cylinder'.
